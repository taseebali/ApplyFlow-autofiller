# Application Dashboard Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace Notion tracking with a dashboard that records every application in full — job description, the exact bullets sent, both finished documents — and answers which wording actually gets replies.

**Architecture:** The record moves from `chrome.storage.local` to IndexedDB, because the current log is capped at 500 entries and shares a ~10MB quota with the profile, snapshots, the bullet bank and the model catalogue — and embedded `.docx` bytes would exhaust it. The dashboard is a static React app deployed to Vercel that holds no data of its own: it asks the extension for records over `externally_connectable` messaging and renders them. Nothing is stored on a server, there is no database, and no account is needed. Notion is deleted last, after the dashboard has proven it records everything Notion did.

**Tech Stack:** IndexedDB (no wrapper library), WXT 0.21, React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Vitest + jsdom, `fake-indexeddb` for tests, Vite for the dashboard app, Vercel for static hosting.

**Spec:** None. This plan is the design record; it was settled in conversation on 2026-09-11, where architecture "B" (Vercel hosts the page, the extension holds the data) and "everything, files embedded" were chosen over a hosted database and over metadata-only records.

## Global Constraints

- Profile and application data stay on the machine. The only outbound traffic remains AI drafting to the configured provider. The dashboard adds no new destination.
- No secret may reach an error message, a log, the page, or the dashboard. The external message handler returns application records only — never settings, never `llm.apiKeys`, never the Notion token while it still exists.
- No API key in `.env`. `scripts/check-no-secrets.mjs` runs as part of `npm run build` and must keep passing.
- Nothing is written into a page or submitted without explicit user action.
- Every task ends green: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test -- --run`, `npm run build`.
- The fixture corpus must not regress: greenhouse 11/11, personio 6/6, ashby 6/6.
- Commit messages carry no `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Extension ID must be stable across reloads, or `externally_connectable` breaks on every rebuild. Task 6 pins it.

## File Structure

**New — extension**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `extension/lib/application-db.ts` | IndexedDB open, upgrade, and the five record operations. The only file that knows IndexedDB exists. |
| `extension/lib/application-db.test.ts` | Tests for the above, against `fake-indexeddb`. |
| `extension/lib/application-record.ts` | The `ApplicationRecord` type, `emptyRecord`, and pure helpers over a list of records. No storage. |
| `extension/lib/application-record.test.ts` | Tests for the pure helpers. |
| `extension/lib/application-migrate.ts` | One-way move of the old `application-log` array into IndexedDB. |
| `extension/lib/application-migrate.test.ts` | Tests for the migration, including running it twice. |
| `extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.ts` | The external-message protocol: request and response types, and the allowlist of origins permitted to ask. |
| `extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.test.ts` | Tests that the allowlist rejects unknown origins and that no settings field can be returned. |

**New — dashboard**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `dashboard/package.json` | Its own npm project. Not part of the extension build. |
| `dashboard/vite.config.ts` | Vite build to `dashboard/dist`. |
| `dashboard/index.html` | Page shell. |
| `dashboard/src/main.tsx` | Mount. |
| `dashboard/src/App.tsx` | Layout, list, and detail routing by selected id. |
| `dashboard/src/bridge.ts` | Talks to the extension. The only file that knows `chrome.runtime` exists. |
| `dashboard/src/ApplicationList.tsx` | Table of applications with status and score. |
| `dashboard/src/ApplicationDetail.tsx` | One application in full, including document download. |
| `dashboard/src/dashboard.css` | Styles, reusing the token names from the extension's `base.css`. |
| `dashboard/vercel.json` | Vercel build settings. |

**Modified — extension**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `extension/lib/application-log.ts` | Becomes a thin forwarder to `application-db.ts`, keeping `summarize` and the CSV export. Deleted in Task 12 once nothing imports it. |
| `extension/entrypoints/background.ts` | Adds the `onMessageExternal` listener; runs the migration on install. |
| `extension/entrypoints/review/ReviewPage.tsx` | On save, writes documents and tailoring detail onto the record. |
| `extension/components/HistorySections.tsx` | Reads records, adds a link to the dashboard. |
| `extension/wxt.config.ts` | Adds `key`, `externally_connectable`; later drops the Notion host permission. |
| `extension/lib/tab-state.ts` | Drops `notion`, in Task 12. |
| `extension/lib/settings.ts` | Drops `notion`, in Task 12. |

**Deleted in Task 12**

`extension/lib/notion-client.ts`, `extension/components/NotionSection.tsx`, and the Notion parts of `IntegrationSections.tsx`, `SetupView.tsx`, `DailyView.tsx`, `setup-groups.ts`.

---

## Task 1: The record type and its pure helpers

**Files:**
- Create: `extension/lib/application-record.ts`
- Test: `extension/lib/application-record.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ApplicationEntry` from `extension/lib/application-log.ts` (existing, for the migration in Task 3).
- Produces: `ApplicationRecord`, `ApplicationStatus`, `STATUSES`, `StoredDocument`, `emptyRecord(seed)`, `summarize(records, now?)`, `ApplicationStats`, `wordingOutcomes(records)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts

    expect(summarize([record({ appliedAt: old })], now).last30Days).toBe(0);
  });

  it('ranks the sites that reject what we write', () => {
    const stats = summarize([
      record({ hostname: 'a.com', invalidCount: 3 }),
      record({ hostname: 'b.com', invalidCount: 1 }),
      record({ hostname: 'a.com', invalidCount: 2 }),
    ]);
    expect(stats.troublesomeSites[0]).toEqual({ hostname: 'a.com', invalid: 5 });
  });
});

describe('wordingOutcomes', () => {
  it('reports how each bullet did, which is the thing Notion could never answer', () => {
    const outcomes = wordingOutcomes([
      record({ variantIds: ['v1', 'v2'], status: 'interview' }),
      record({ variantIds: ['v1'], status: 'rejected' }),
      record({ variantIds: ['v1'], status: 'applied' }),
    ]);
    const v1 = outcomes.find((o) => o.variantId === 'v1')!;
    expect(v1.sent).toBe(3);
    expect(v1.replied).toBe(2);
  });

  it('says nothing about a bullet never sent', () => {
    expect(wordingOutcomes([record({ variantIds: [] })])).toEqual([]);
  });

## Task 4: The dashboard bridge protocol

**Files:**
- Create: `extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.ts`
- Test: `extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ApplicationRecord`, `ApplicationStatus` from Task 1.
- Produces: `DashboardRequest`, `DashboardResponse`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `isAllowedOrigin(origin)`, `handleDashboardRequest(request, deps)`, `TransferableRecord`, `toTransferable(record)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts

```ts

/**
 * What the dashboard may ask the extension, and what it gets back.
 *
 * The dashboard is a web page on someone else's host. It holds no data: it asks
 * for records and renders them. That makes this file the boundary, and the
 * boundary is built as an allowlist — the response is assembled field by field
 * from the record, never spread from an object that might carry more. A
 * redaction list would have to be updated every time a field is added; an
 * allowlist fails closed.
 *
 * Document bytes are sent only for a single application, and only when asked.
 * A list of fifty applications with two .docx files each would be four
 * megabytes through a message channel that serialises to JSON.

## Task 5: Wire the bridge into the background worker

**Files:**
- Modify: `extension/entrypoints/background.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `handleDashboardRequest`, `isAllowedOrigin` from Task 4; `listRecords`, `getRecord`, `patchRecord` from Task 2; `migrateApplicationLog` from Task 3.
- Produces: nothing importable. Registers `browser.runtime.onMessageExternal` and runs the migration on install.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the listener and the migration**

Add near the other listeners inside `defineBackground(() => { ... })`:

```ts
  /*
   * The dashboard asks; the extension answers.
   *
   * The dashboard is a static page with no storage and no server behind it, so
   * every record it shows comes through here. Two gates, deliberately: the
   * manifest's `externally_connectable` decides who may send at all, and this
   * checks the origin again — a mistake in one should not be the only thing
   * between a web page and an application history.
   */
  browser.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(
    (request: DashboardRequest, sender, sendResponse: (response: DashboardResponse) => void) => {
      if (!sender.origin || !isAllowedOrigin(sender.origin)) {
        sendResponse({ ok: false, error: 'Not an allowed origin.' });
        return false;
      }

      void handleDashboardRequest(request, {
        list: listRecords,
        get: getRecord,
        patch: patchRecord,
      })
        .then(sendResponse)
        .catch(() => sendResponse({ ok: false, error: 'Could not read applications.' }));

      return true;
    }
  );

  // One-way, and a no-op after the first run. The old log is capped at 500
  // entries and cannot hold documents, so nothing is left behind on purpose.
  browser.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    void migrateApplicationLog();
  });
```

Add the imports at the top:

```ts
import { handleDashboardRequest, isAllowedOrigin, type DashboardRequest, type DashboardResponse } from '@/lib/dashboard-bridge';
import { getRecord, listRecords, patchRecord } from '@/lib/application-db';
import { migrateApplicationLog } from '@/lib/application-migrate';
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify it compiles**

Run: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the whole suite**

Run: `cd extension && npm run test -- --run`
Expected: PASS, no regressions.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add extension/entrypoints/background.ts
git commit -m "Answer the dashboard, and check the origin twice"
```

---

## Task 6: Pin the extension ID and declare the dashboard origin

**Files:**
- Modify: `extension/wxt.config.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` from Task 4 (the manifest must list the same origins).
- Produces: a stable extension ID, and `externally_connectable` in the built manifest.

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate a key pair for a stable ID**

```bash
cd extension && openssl genrsa -out ../applyflow-extension.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ../applyflow-extension.pem -pubout -outform DER | openssl base64 -A
```

Copy the printed base64. Add `applyflow-extension.pem` to the repo's `.gitignore` — it is a signing key and must not be committed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the key and the connectable origins**

In `extension/wxt.config.ts`, inside `manifest`:

```ts
    /*
     * Pins the extension ID.
     *
     * Without this, an unpacked extension gets a new ID on every load, and
     * `externally_connectable` is keyed on that ID — so the dashboard would
     * lose its connection to the extension on every rebuild. The public half of
     * the key pair is safe to commit; the private half is in
     * applyflow-extension.pem, which is gitignored.
     */
    key: 'PASTE_BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE',

    /*
     * Which pages may message this extension. Nothing else can, whatever it
     * sends. The list matches ALLOWED_ORIGINS in lib/dashboard-bridge.ts; both
     * exist so that a mistake in either one alone is not enough.
     */
    externally_connectable: {
      matches: ['https://applyflow-dashboard.vercel.app/*', 'http://localhost:5174/*'],
    },
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Build and confirm the manifest**

Run: `cd extension && npm run build`
Then: `node -e "const m=require('./.output/chrome-mv3/manifest.json');console.log(m.externally_connectable, !!m.key)"`
Expected: the two matches printed, and `true`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Record the extension ID**

Load `extension/.output/chrome-mv3` unpacked in Brave, copy the ID from `brave://extensions`, and note it — Task 8 needs it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add extension/wxt.config.ts .gitignore
git commit -m "Pin the extension id so the dashboard can find it after a rebuild"
```

---

## Task 7: Record the whole application on save

**Files:**
- Modify: `extension/entrypoints/review/ReviewPage.tsx`
- Modify: `extension/components/FillSection.tsx`
- Test: `extension/lib/application-record.test.ts` (extend)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `patchRecord` from Task 2; `ApplicationRecord` from Task 1; the existing `tabState.applicationId`.
- Produces: nothing importable. Fills `jobDescription`, `matchScore`, `gapCovered`, `gapMissing`, `variantIds`, `estimatedFigures`, `resume`, `coverLetter` on the record.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `extension/lib/application-record.test.ts`:

```ts
import { documentFromBlob } from './application-record';

describe('documentFromBlob', () => {
  it('keeps the bytes and the name it was saved under', async () => {
    // The filename matters as much as the bytes: saveToDocumentsFolder renames
    // on collision, so what is on disk may not be what was asked for.
    const blob = new Blob([new Uint8Array([0x50, 0x4b, 0x03, 0x04])]);
    const doc = await documentFromBlob('Taseeb_Ali_Resume_Enpal (1).docx', blob, 1234);
    expect(doc.filename).toBe('Taseeb_Ali_Resume_Enpal (1).docx');
    expect(doc.savedAt).toBe(1234);
    expect(new Uint8Array(doc.bytes)).toEqual(new Uint8Array([0x50, 0x4b, 0x03, 0x04]));
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd extension && npx vitest run lib/application-record.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `documentFromBlob is not a function`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the helper**

Append to `extension/lib/application-record.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * A saved file, ready to store.
 *
 * `Blob.arrayBuffer()` is missing in jsdom, where the tests run, so the
 * FileReader path is the one that works in both places — the same reason
 * `resume-text.ts` reads files the way it does.
 */
export async function documentFromBlob(
  filename: string,
  blob: Blob,
  savedAt = Date.now()
): Promise<StoredDocument> {
  const bytes = await (typeof blob.arrayBuffer === 'function'
    ? blob.arrayBuffer()
    : new Promise<ArrayBuffer>((resolve, reject) => {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result as ArrayBuffer);
        reader.onerror = () => reject(reader.error);
        reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);
      }));
  return { filename, bytes, savedAt };
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd extension && npx vitest run lib/application-record.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, 7 tests.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the documents onto the record when review saves**

In `extension/entrypoints/review/ReviewPage.tsx`, inside `save()`, after `setSaved(names)`:

```ts
      /*
       * The record is the point of saving, not a side effect of it. Everything
       * that made this application what it is — the posting, the score, the
       * bullets that went out, the figures that were estimated, and both files
       * as bytes — is written here, where all of it is in hand at once.
       */
      const tabId = handoff.tabId;
      const applicationId = tabId === undefined ? undefined : (await getTabState(tabId)).applicationId;
      if (applicationId) {
        await patchRecord(applicationId, {
          jobDescription: handoff.jobDescription,
          matchScore: score,
          gapCovered: handoff.result.gap.covered.map((g) => g.term),
          gapMissing: handoff.result.gap.missing.map((g) => g.term),
          variantIds: bullets.map((b) => b.id),
          estimatedFigures: estimates,
          resume: resumeBlob ? await documentFromBlob(names[0]!, resumeBlob) : null,
          coverLetter: letterBlob && names[1] ? await documentFromBlob(names[1], letterBlob) : null,
        });
      }
```

The blobs are currently built inline inside the `saveToDocumentsFolder(...)` call
and thrown away. Hold them first. Replace the body of `save()` between
`const names: string[] = [];` and `setSaved(names);` with:

```ts
      // Held rather than passed straight through: the same bytes that go to the
      // documents folder go onto the record, and building them twice would let
      // the two copies drift.
      let resumeBlob: Blob | null = null;
      let letterBlob: Blob | null = null;

      if (combine && letterDocument) {
        const combinedBlob = await combinedToDocxBlob(document, letterDocument);
        resumeBlob = combinedBlob;
        names.push(
          await saveToDocumentsFolder(handle, combinedFilename(document, company), combinedBlob)
        );
      } else {
        resumeBlob = await toDocxBlob(document);
        names.push(await saveToDocumentsFolder(handle, resumeFilename(document, company), resumeBlob));

        if (letterDocument) {
          letterBlob = await coverLetterToDocxBlob(letterDocument);
          names.push(
            await saveToDocumentsFolder(handle, coverLetterFilename(document, company), letterBlob)
          );
        }
      }
```

`resumeBlob` holds the combined file in the combined case, which is correct: it
is the one document that was sent, and `names[0]` is the name it was saved
under.

`ReviewHandoff` has no `tabId`. Add it in `extension/lib/review-handoff.ts`:

```ts
export interface ReviewHandoff {
  result: TailorResult;
  letter: CoverLetterResult | null;
  company: string;
  role: string;
  jobDescription: string;
  createdAt: number;
  /** The tab this was built from, so the saved documents reach its record. */
  tabId?: number;
}
```

And set it in `extension/components/TailorCard.tsx` where `putReview` is called, passing `await getActiveTabId()`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify and commit**

Run: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test -- --run && npm run build`
Expected: all pass.

```bash
git add extension/entrypoints/review/ReviewPage.tsx extension/lib/review-handoff.ts extension/components/TailorCard.tsx extension/lib/application-record.ts extension/lib/application-record.test.ts
git commit -m "Keep the posting, the bullets and both documents with the application"
```

## Task 8: The dashboard app

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/package.json`, `dashboard/vite.config.ts`, `dashboard/index.html`, `dashboard/tsconfig.json`
- Create: `dashboard/src/main.tsx`, `dashboard/src/bridge.ts`, `dashboard/src/App.tsx`, `dashboard/src/dashboard.css`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the message protocol from Task 4 — `DashboardRequest`, `DashboardResponse`, `TransferableRecord`, `DetailedRecord`. These are re-declared in `dashboard/src/bridge.ts` rather than imported, because the dashboard is a separate npm project with no path into the extension.
- Produces: `askExtension(request)`, `EXTENSION_ID`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Scaffold the project**

```bash
mkdir -p dashboard/src && cd dashboard
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom
npm install --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-react typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/chrome
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the config files**

`dashboard/vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // Must match the port in ALLOWED_ORIGINS and externally_connectable, or the
  // extension refuses to answer during development.
  server: { port: 5174 },
});
```

`dashboard/index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>ApplyFlow — Applications</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`dashboard/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "types": ["chrome"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the bridge**

`dashboard/src/bridge.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The dashboard's only link to its data.
 *
 * There is no server and no database. Every record is held by the extension on
 * this machine, and this page asks for it over `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
 * That is the whole reason the dashboard can be a public URL without anything
 * of yours being on it: open it in a browser without the extension and it shows
 * nothing, because there is nothing there to show.
 *
 * The types below mirror lib/dashboard-bridge.ts in the extension. They are
 * copied rather than imported because this is a separate npm project; if you
 * change one, change both.
 */

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the app shell**

`dashboard/src/main.tsx`:

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { App } from './App';
import './dashboard.css';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

`dashboard/src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { askExtension, NoExtensionError, type TransferableRecord } from './bridge';
import { ApplicationList } from './ApplicationList';
import { ApplicationDetail } from './ApplicationDetail';

export function App() {
  const [records, setRecords] = useState<TransferableRecord[] | null>(null);
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const refresh = () => {

        else setError('ApplyFlow refused the request.');
      })
      .catch((err) => setError(err instanceof NoExtensionError ? err.message : 'Could not reach ApplyFlow.'));

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify it builds**

Run: `cd dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vite build`

## Task 9: The list and the detail view

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/src/ApplicationList.tsx`
- Create: `dashboard/src/ApplicationDetail.tsx`
- Create: `dashboard/src/dashboard.css`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `askExtension`, `toBlobUrl`, `STATUSES`, `TransferableRecord`, `DetailedRecord` from Task 8.
- Produces: `ApplicationList({ records, onOpen })`, `ApplicationDetail({ id, onBack, onChanged })`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the list**

`dashboard/src/ApplicationList.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { TransferableRecord } from './bridge';

const date = (ms: number) => new Date(ms).toLocaleDateString();

export function ApplicationList({
  records,
  onOpen,
}: {
  records: TransferableRecord[];
  onOpen: (id: string) => void;
}) {
  if (records.length === 0) {
    return <p className="hint">Nothing applied for yet. Fill an application and it appears here.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <table className="dash-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Company</th>
          <th>Role</th>
          <th>Applied</th>
          <th>Match</th>
          <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {records.map((r) => (
          <tr key={r.id} onClick={() => onOpen(r.id)} tabIndex={0}>
            <td>{r.company || r.hostname}</td>
            <td>{r.title}</td>
            <td>{date(r.appliedAt)}</td>
            <td>{r.matchScore ?? '—'}</td>
            <td><span className={`chip chip-${r.status}`}>{r.status}</span></td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the detail view**

`dashboard/src/ApplicationDetail.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { askExtension, toBlobUrl, STATUSES, type DetailedRecord, type ApplicationStatus } from './bridge';

export function ApplicationDetail({
  id,
  onBack,
  onChanged,
}: {
  id: string;
  onBack: () => void;
  onChanged: () => void;
}) {
  const [record, setRecord] = useState<DetailedRecord | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    void askExtension({ type: 'get', id }).then((r) => {
      if (r.ok && r.record) setRecord(r.record);
    });
  }, [id]);

  if (!record) return <p className="hint">Loading…</p>;

  const setStatus = async (status: ApplicationStatus) => {
    await askExtension({ type: 'set-status', id, status });
    setRecord({ ...record, status });
    onChanged();
  };

  return (
    <article className="dash-detail">
      <button type="button" onClick={onBack}>← All applications</button>

      <h2>{record.company} — {record.title}</h2>
      <p><a href={record.url} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">{record.url}</a></p>

      <label>
        Status{' '}
        <select value={record.status} onChange={(e) => void setStatus(e.target.value as ApplicationStatus)}>
          {STATUSES.map((s) => <option key={s} value={s}>{s}</option>)}
        </select>
      </label>

      <section>
        <h3>What was sent</h3>
        <ul>
          {/* Downloaded from bytes held on this machine. Nothing was uploaded
              to produce this link. */}
          {record.resume && (
            <li>
              <a href={toBlobUrl(record.resume.base64)} download={record.resume.filename}>
                {record.resume.filename}
              </a>
            </li>
          )}
          {record.coverLetter && (
            <li>
              <a href={toBlobUrl(record.coverLetter.base64)} download={record.coverLetter.filename}>
                {record.coverLetter.filename}
              </a>
            </li>
          )}
          {!record.resume && !record.coverLetter && <li className="hint">No documents recorded.</li>}
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Match</h3>
        <p>{record.matchScore === null ? 'Not scored.' : `${record.matchScore} / 100`}</p>
        <p className="hint">Covered: {record.gapCovered.join(', ') || '—'}</p>
        <p className="hint">Missing: {record.gapMissing.join(', ') || '—'}</p>
        {record.estimatedFigures.length > 0 && (
          <p className="hint">Estimated figures sent: {record.estimatedFigures.join(', ')}</p>
        )}
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The posting</h3>
        <pre className="dash-jd">{record.jobDescription || 'Not captured.'}</pre>
      </section>
    </article>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the styles**

`dashboard/src/dashboard.css` — reuse the extension's token names and the plum-magenta accent so the two surfaces read as one product:

```css
:root {
  --brand: #9e3389;
  --bg: #fafafa;
  --surface: #ffffff;
  --text: #0c0d0f;
  --text-muted: #6c727a;
  --border: #e4e6e9;
  --accent: var(--brand);
  --accent-bg: oklch(from var(--brand) 0.95 0.03 h);
  --sans: 'Geist Variable', -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
}

:root:not([data-theme='light']) {
  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    --bg: #0c0d0f;
    --surface: #131518;
    --text: #edeef0;
    --text-muted: #8c939b;
    --border: #23262b;
    --accent: oklch(from var(--brand) 0.73 c h);
    --accent-bg: oklch(from var(--brand) 0.24 0.045 h);
  }
}

body { margin: 0; background: var(--bg); color: var(--text); font-family: var(--sans); }
.dash { max-width: 1100px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 32px 24px 80px; }
.dash h1 { font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.02em; }
.hint { color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 13px; }
.error { color: #b3261e; }

.dash-table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px; }
.dash-table th { text-align: left; font-size: 11px; text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.07em; color: var(--text-muted); padding: 8px 10px; }
.dash-table td { padding: 10px; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); }
.dash-table tbody tr:hover { background: var(--accent-bg); cursor: pointer; }

.chip { padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 999px; font-size: 11px; background: var(--accent-bg); color: var(--accent); }

.dash-detail section { margin-top: 24px; }
.dash-jd { white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: inherit; font-size: 13px;
  background: var(--surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: 8px; padding: 12px; }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify**

Run: `cd dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vite build`
Expected: clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Manual check against the real extension**

1. `cd dashboard && npx vite` — serves on `http://localhost:5174`.
2. Load `extension/.output/chrome-mv3` unpacked.
3. Paste the extension ID into `EXTENSION_ID` in `dashboard/src/bridge.ts`.
4. Open `http://localhost:5174`. Expected: the applications list, or "Nothing applied for yet."
5. Open the same URL in a browser without the extension. Expected: "ApplyFlow is not installed in this browser."

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add dashboard
git commit -m "Show the application, the documents and the posting it came from"
```

---

## Task 10: Deploy to Vercel

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/vercel.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the Vercel config**

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": null
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Deploy**

```bash
cd dashboard && npx vercel --prod
```

Set the project root to `dashboard/` when prompted.

- [ ] **Step 3: Reconcile the deployed origin**

Vercel's assigned URL will not be `applyflow-dashboard.vercel.app` unless that name is free. Take the real URL and update **both** places, which must agree:

- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.ts`
- `externally_connectable.matches` in `extension/wxt.config.ts`

- [ ] **Step 4: Rebuild, reload, verify**

Run: `cd extension && npm run test -- --run && npm run build`

Reload the unpacked extension, open the deployed URL. Expected: the list renders. The origin test in `dashboard-bridge.test.ts` must be updated to the real host in the same commit.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add dashboard/vercel.json extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.ts extension/lib/dashboard-bridge.test.ts extension/wxt.config.ts
git commit -m "Deploy the dashboard and point the extension at its real origin"
```

---

## Task 11: Point the extension at the dashboard

**Files:**
- Modify: `extension/components/HistorySections.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace the history list with a link and a summary**

`ApplicationHistorySection` currently reads `getApplications()` and renders a table. Change it to read `listRecords()`, show `summarize()` output, and offer a link out:

```tsx
        {/* The panel is 400px. The dashboard is where this is actually read —
            the panel keeps the summary and hands over. */}
        <a className="btn" href={DASHBOARD_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Open the dashboard
        </a>
```

with `const DASHBOARD_URL = 'https://<deployed-host>/';` at the top of the file.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify and commit**

Run: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test -- --run && npm run build`

```bash
git add extension/components/HistorySections.tsx
git commit -m "Hand the history off to the dashboard, keep the summary in the panel"
```

---

## Task 12: Delete Notion

**Files:**
- Delete: `extension/lib/notion-client.ts`, `extension/lib/notion-client.test.ts`, `extension/components/NotionSection.tsx`
- Modify: `extension/lib/settings.ts`, `extension/lib/tab-state.ts`, `extension/lib/setup-groups.ts`, `extension/components/IntegrationSections.tsx`, `extension/components/SetupView.tsx`, `extension/components/DailyView.tsx`, `extension/lib/application-log.ts`, `extension/wxt.config.ts`

**Do this last.** Until the dashboard has recorded a real application end to end, Notion is the only working tracker and removing it leaves a gap.

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete the files**

```bash
cd extension && rm lib/notion-client.ts lib/notion-client.test.ts components/NotionSection.tsx
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove the references**

- `lib/settings.ts` — drop `notion` from the `Settings` interface, from `EMPTY_SETTINGS`, and from `applySettingsDefaults`.
- `lib/tab-state.ts` — drop `notion?: { loggedUrl: string }`.
- `lib/setup-groups.ts` — drop the Notion entry.
- `components/IntegrationSections.tsx` — drop `NotionSettingsSection`.
- `components/SetupView.tsx` — drop the Notion step and its `notion` state.
- `components/DailyView.tsx` — drop `<LogToNotionSection />`.
- `lib/application-log.ts` — delete the file; nothing imports it after Task 11. Confirm with `grep -rn "application-log" --include=*.ts --include=*.tsx .`

- [ ] **Step 3: Drop the host permission and fix the description**

In `extension/wxt.config.ts`: remove `'https://api.notion.com/*'` from `host_permissions`, and change `description` to end `"…autofill, document attach, AI drafts, and a dashboard of everything you have applied to."`

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify nothing is left**

```bash
cd extension && grep -rin "notion" --include=*.ts --include=*.tsx --include=*.json . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '\.output' | grep -v '\.wxt'
```

Expected: only `lib/application-record.ts` if a comment mentions the history, and `docs/`. No code.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run everything**

Run: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test -- --run && npm run build`
Expected: all pass, no credentials found in build output, corpus at greenhouse 11/11, personio 6/6, ashby 6/6.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add -A extension
git commit -m "Remove Notion

The dashboard records everything the Notion row did and more — the posting,
the exact bullets sent, both documents as bytes. Notion needed a token, a
database set up by hand, a host permission, and a network destination for data
that never had to leave the machine.

Deletes notion-client.ts, NotionSection.tsx, the settings and tab-state
fields, the setup step and the api.notion.com host permission."
```

---

## Task 13: Update the store listing

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/store-listing.md`, `README.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite the affected sections**

In `docs/store-listing.md`: remove Notion from the feature list and the permission justifications; remove the `api.notion.com` justification; add one for the dashboard origin explaining that `externally_connectable` lets a named page **ask** the extension for data and that nothing is sent anywhere.

The data-handling disclosure does not change, and that is the point worth stating plainly in the listing: the dashboard adds no server, no account and no new destination.

In `README.md`: replace the Notion tracking bullet with the dashboard.

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/store-listing.md README.md
git commit -m "Say what the dashboard is and what it does not send"
```

---

## Verification

**Automated, after every task:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test -- --run`, `npm run build`. The corpus holds at greenhouse 11/11, personio 6/6, ashby 6/6.

**Manual, and this is the real gate:**

1. Fill a real application. Tailor a resume and a letter. Save both from the review tab.
2. Open the dashboard. The application is there, with the score, the posting, and both files downloadable.
3. Download the resume from the dashboard. Open it. It is the document that was sent.
4. Set the status to `interview`. Reload. It stuck.
5. Open the dashboard URL in a browser **without** ApplyFlow installed. It says the extension is not installed and shows nothing.
6. Open dev tools on the dashboard, run `chrome.runtime.sendMessage(EXTENSION_ID, {type:'read-settings'})`. Expected: `{ok: false, error: 'Unknown request.'}` — no settings, no key.

Step 6 is the one that matters most. The dashboard is a public URL, and the only thing standing between it and everything else in the extension is the allowlist in `dashboard-bridge.ts`.

## Notes and risks

- **`externally_connectable` is keyed on the extension ID.** Task 6 pins it with `key`. Skip that and the dashboard breaks on every rebuild, silently, in a way that looks like the dashboard being broken rather than the ID having moved.
- **Document bytes are sent base64 over a JSON channel.** Fine for one application at ~55KB encoded per file; that is why the list never carries them. If a record ever needs to carry a PDF as well, revisit before adding it.
- **Records are never deleted automatically.** The old log capped at 500 to protect a shared quota; IndexedDB has no such pressure, so nothing ages out. If storage becomes a real problem, add a manual clear before adding an automatic one — this is the only copy of what was sent.
- **The private key in `applyflow-extension.pem` must never be committed.** It is the extension's identity. `scripts/check-no-secrets.mjs` should be extended to fail on a committed `.pem`.
